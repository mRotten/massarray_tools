# massarray_tools

This module is not fit for general use. It's a collection of quick-and-dirty methods for:

* identifying mass spectrum gaps (Masshole_Finder)
* designing 5'-appendages to reach a target oligonucleotide mass (Mass_Blaster)
* parsing the .xml output from the MassARRAY (MA_Experiment)
* visualizing MassARRAY output (MA_Data_Grapher)

Maybe I'll clean it up one day if it can be repurposed, but I am not planning to develop tests on the MassARRAY ever (ever) again.
